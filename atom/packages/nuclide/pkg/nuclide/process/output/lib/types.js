/**
 * A function that can be optionally passed to ProcessOutputView to override
 * ProcessOutputView's default behavior for handling new data from the process.
 * By default, ProcessOutputView simply appends the `newText` to its `buffer`.
 * However, for example sometimes the output may contain escape sequences
 * (e.g. ANSI) that you want to interpret and strip from the data before appending
 * to the buffer. You can do this by implementing a custom ProcessOutputHandler.
