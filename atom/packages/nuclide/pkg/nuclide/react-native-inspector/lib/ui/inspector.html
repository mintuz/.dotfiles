          <h3>Troubleshooting Tips:</h3>
          <ul id="connecting-screen-tips">
            <li>
              Make sure a React Native app is running and that it's in DEV mode.
            </li>
            <li>
              Only one element inspector can be active at a time. Close any other open inspectors.
            </li>
            <li>
              There may be a zombie element inspector instance running. Try reopening your Atom
              window or check port 8097.

        // JS host and patch it. That way, the standalone script will be able to find its

        // See https://github.com/atom/electron/issues/2631 for explanation.
