If you\nhave never installed an Atom package before, follow the\n[package installation instructions](https://atom.io/docs/latest/using-atom-atom-packages#_atom_packages)\nfrom the [Atom Flight Manual](https://atom.io/docs/latest/) to do it through the Atom UI, or run the\nfollowing from the command line:\n\n```bash\n$ apm install nuclide\n```\n\n### Server Installation\n\nNuclide supports [Remote Development](http://nuclide.io/docs/remote/) via a process that runs on the\nremote machine where you want to edit files. Nuclide's server is distributed as the\n['nuclide' NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nuclide). This is optional and only needed if\nyou want to edit remote files from within Atom+Nuclide. To install the server, run the following\ncommand on the machine where the remote files live:\n\n```bash\n$ npm install -g nuclide\n```\n\n## Building from Source\n\nIf you want to experiment with modifications to Nuclide's code, we recommend that you build it from\nsource.\n\nFirst clone the repo:\n\n```bash\n$ git clone https://github.com/facebook/nuclide.git\n```\n\nInstall Nuclide's dependencies:\n\n```bash\n$ cd nuclide\n$ npm install\n```\n\nThen link Nuclide as a development Atom package:\n\n```bash\n$ apm link -d\n```\n\nWhen you open Atom in development mode, either with `atom --dev` from the command line or with the\n`Application: Open Dev` command from within Atom, your linked version of Nuclide will load in place\nof any other version of 'nuclide' you might have installed.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/issues"},"_id":"nuclide@0.114.0","_shasum":"f2ddc4db8c0355eb041e30bf77a94a557dee0496","_resolved":"file:../d-116029-59188-12x51bk/package.tgz","_from":"../d-116029-59188-12x51bk/package.tgz"}
