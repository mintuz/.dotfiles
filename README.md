Hello, this is my personal 2016 OSX setup. Probably more things I can automate but it's not like i'm doing this everyday. I've had to update this because of a future rebuild of my works laptop, and I don't want much downtime. Time is code. I've decided to consolidate both my provisioning script and my actual .dotfiles directories.

*** Things this script will do for you ***
* Setup atom with common packages for JS Web Developers
* Setup a sane gitconfig
* Setup a folder structure for projects within your home directory.
* Install tools and apps where they can be automated
* Remind me what else to install if it can't be automated.

# Setup

Git clone this project into your home directory then follow out the steps below

## Move this directory to be hidden
```
mv ~/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
```

## Setup OSX Defaults mainly UI tweaks.

```
~/.dotfiles/scripts/osxdefaults
```

## Swap to ZSH and bring over some default config files

```
~/.dotfiles/scripts/setup.sh
```

## Provision OSX with tools and apps I use

```
~/.dotfiles/scripts/provision.sh
```

## Some other steps to take

### App Store Apps to download
* XScope
* Sketch
* Omnigraffle 6
* Patterns
* OnePassword

### Games to download
* Starcraft 2
* Heroes of the storm
* Guild Wars 2
* League of Legends

### Stuff to not store in repo
* Pull in BBC Related dotfiles from private repo.
* Restore backup certificates
* Setup Email clients again
* Install Chrome extension (Authy)
* Setup auth to personal webserver.
