  WHEN scraping iOS/macOS App Store data (apps, reviews, ratings, search);
  NOT for installing or testing apps; retrieves structured JSON data using iTunes/App Store APIs with curl and jq formatting
---

# App Store Scraper

Comprehensive toolkit for retrieving structured data from Apple's App Store and iTunes APIs using curl and jq. All endpoints return JSON that can be parsed and formatted for analysis.

## Quick Start

**Tools Required:**
- `curl` for HTTP requests
- `jq` for JSON parsing and formatting

**Example:**
```bash
# Get app details
curl -s "https://itunes.apple.com/lookup?id=553834731&entity=software" | \
  jq '.results[0] | {name: .trackName, rating: .averageUserRating}'
```

## Decision Trees

```

### 🌍 Decision Tree 4: Regional & Multi-App Queries

```
Do you need region-specific or multi-app data?
│
├─ Multi-Region Analysis
│  ├─ Compare ratings across regions → [Ratings Histogram](endpoints/ratings.md)
│  └─ Get reviews from different regions → [Reviews](endpoints/reviews.md)
│
├─ Bulk Operations
│  ├─ Lookup multiple apps → [App Lookup](endpoints/app-lookup.md)
│  └─ Search and filter results → [App Search](endpoints/search.md)

   └─ Browse by specific categories → [App Lists/Feeds](endpoints/lists.md)
```

## 📚 Documentation Index

### Endpoints (API-Based)

Reliable, structured API endpoints that return JSON:

| Endpoint | Description | File |
|----------|-------------|------|
| **App Lookup** | Get detailed app info by ID or bundle ID | [endpoints/app-lookup.md](endpoints/app-lookup.md) |
| **App Search** | Search apps by keyword with filters | [endpoints/search.md](endpoints/search.md) |
| **App Lists/Feeds** | Browse top apps and categories | [endpoints/lists.md](endpoints/lists.md) |
| **Developer Apps** | Get all apps by a specific developer | [endpoints/developer.md](endpoints/developer.md) |
| **Reviews** | Fetch paginated user reviews | [endpoints/reviews.md](endpoints/reviews.md) |
| **Ratings Histogram** | Get 1-5 star rating breakdown | [endpoints/ratings.md](endpoints/ratings.md) |
| **Search Suggestions** | Get autocomplete search hints | [endpoints/suggestions.md](endpoints/suggestions.md) |

### Endpoints (Web Scraping)

Requires HTML parsing, less reliable:

| Endpoint | Description | File |
|----------|-------------|------|
| **Similar Apps** | Find related apps (web scraping) | [endpoints/similar.md](endpoints/similar.md) |

## Common Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Competitive Analysis

```bash
# 1. Search for competitor apps
curl -s "https://itunes.apple.com/search?term=note%20taking&media=software&entity=software&limit=10"

# 3. Compare ratings, features, pricing
# 4. Analyze user reviews

See: [App Search](endpoints/search.md) → [App Lookup](endpoints/app-lookup.md) → [Reviews](endpoints/reviews.md)
```

### Use Case 2: App Monitoring

```bash
# 1. Get current app state
# 2. Track rating changes over time
# 3. Monitor new reviews
# 4. Alert on rating drops

See: [App Lookup](endpoints/app-lookup.md) → [Ratings Histogram](endpoints/ratings.md) → [Reviews](endpoints/reviews.md)
```

### Use Case 3: Market Research

```bash
# 1. Browse top apps in category
# 2. Analyze pricing trends
# 3. Study feature patterns
# 4. Identify gaps in market

See: [App Lists/Feeds](endpoints/lists.md) → [App Search](endpoints/search.md)
```

### Use Case 4: Developer Portfolio Analysis

```bash
# 1. Find developer ID from an app
# 2. Get all apps by developer
# 3. Compare performance across portfolio
# 4. Track developer strategy

See: [App Lookup](endpoints/app-lookup.md) → [Developer Apps](endpoints/developer.md)
```

## Quick Reference

### Essential Parameters

- **country** - Market code (default: `us`)
- **entity** - Always use `software` for apps
- **limit** - Max results (varies by endpoint)
- **lang** - Language preference (e.g., `en-US`, `ja-JP`)

### Common Country Codes

| Code | Country | Code | Country |
|------|---------|------|---------|
| `us` | United States | `gb` | United Kingdom |
| `de` | Germany | `fr` | France |
| `jp` | Japan | `au` | Australia |
| `ca` | Canada | `es` | Spain |
| `it` | Italy | `br` | Brazil |
| `in` | India | `mx` | Mexico |
| `kr` | South Korea | `cn` | China |

### Common Commands

```bash
# Get app by ID
curl -s "https://itunes.apple.com/lookup?id=553834731&entity=software" | jq '.results[0]'

# Search apps
curl -s "https://itunes.apple.com/search?term=weather&media=software&entity=software&limit=10"

# Top free apps
curl -s "https://itunes.apple.com/us/rss/topfreeapplications/limit=25/json"

# Recent reviews
curl -s "https://itunes.apple.com/us/rss/customerreviews/page=1/id=553834731/sortby=mostrecent/json"
```

## Best Practices

1. **Validate responses** before processing with `jq empty`
2. **Implement caching** to reduce API load
3. **Add rate limiting** (1-2s between requests)
4. **Batch requests** when possible using comma-separated IDs
5. **Handle errors gracefully** with retries and fallbacks

## API Limitations

- **Rate limiting**: No official limits, but be respectful (1-2s between requests)
- **Pagination**: Limited on some endpoints (max 200 results for search)
- **History**: Only current version data available via API
- **Web scraping**: Required for similar apps (unreliable, structure may change)
